''"""Rules of the game
Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

->Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
->Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
->If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
->The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
->Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
->If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
->If not, then Player 2 wins the game.
->The real game, however, has proved aesthetics since the numbers are represented by color-coded buttons.''"""
